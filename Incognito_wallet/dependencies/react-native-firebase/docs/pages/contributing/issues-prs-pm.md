# Issues, Pull Requests & Project Management

A lot of time is spent handling GitHub Issues, GitHub Pull Requests and doing general project management and planning.

We appreciate all contributions that help us manage this repository. If you'd like to help, the following areas are a great place to get started.

## Issues Management

### Review

Here are some example review checks that can be taken on issues;

- Does the issue follow the [issue template](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)?
- Is this issue a duplicate? Label it as `Resolution: Duplicate`, comment and link to the duplicate, close the issue.
- Is the issue a feature request? Close the issue and point it to the [Feedback](/feedback) page.
- Does the issue provide a reproduction (if possible)? Label it as `Resolution: Needs Repro` and request a reproduction from the author.
- Is the issue fairly straightforward to fix? Label it `Help: Good First Issue` and comment on the issue asking for contributions; provide as much detail as you can on how you'd go about fixing the issue - so new contributors know where to start.
- Label the issue. There are many labels that can be applied to issues to help with filtering; please see the [labels list](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/labels) to view them and their descriptions.

## Pull Request Management

- Ensuring any code changes cover both Android & iOS surface areas.
- Updates must not change the API surface area unless discussed on our [Discord](https://invertase.link/discord) server.
- All code additions must be fully tested.
- All code additions must be typed, with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/).
